<p>Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied. Fixtures are used to feed some data to the tests such as database connections, URLs to test and some sort of input data. Therefore, instead of running the same code for every test, we can attach fixture function to the tests and it will run and return the data to the test before executing each test.</p><p>A function is marked as a fixture by −</p><p>@pytest.fixture</p><p>To access the fixture function, the tests have to mention the fixture name as input parameter.</p><p>Pytest while the test is getting executed, will see the fixture name as input parameter. It then executes the fixture function and the returned value is stored to the input parameter, which can be used by the test.</p><p>However, the approach comes with its own limitation. A fixture function defined inside atest file has a scope within the test file only. We cannot use that fixture in another test file. To make a fixture available to multiple test files, we have to define the fixture function in a file called conftest.py.</p><p>We can define the fixture functions in this file to make them accessible across multiple test files.</p><p>Create a new file conftest.py and add the fixture code into it</p><p>The tests will look for fixture in the same file. As the fixture is not found in the file, it will check for fixture in conftest.py file. On finding it, the fixture method is invoked and the result is returned to the input argument of the test.</p><p>Parameterizing of a test is done to run the test against multiple sets of inputs. We can do this by using the following marker −</p><p>@pytest.mark.parametrize</p>
