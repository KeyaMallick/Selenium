<p>An alert on the web page is used to get the attention of the user to perform some operation. Generally alerts are performed using javascripts inside the HTML page. Alerts take the focus away from the current window and force the browser to read the message. Alerts prevents the user from accessing other parts of the web page until the box is closed. To handle the alerts we need to first switch to the alert and then accept or dismiss the alert.<br></p>
