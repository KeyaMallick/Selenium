<p>Pytest is the python based testing framework which is used to write and execute test codes. Pytest can run multiple tests in parallel, which reduces the execution time of the test suite. Pytest has its own way to detect the test file and test functions automatically, if not mentioned explicitly. Pytest allows us to skip a subset of the tests during execution. Pytest allows us to run a subset of the entire test suite. Pytest is free and open source. Because of its simple syntax, pytest is very easy to start with.</p><p>Running pytest without mentioning a filename will run all files of format test_*.py or *_test.py in the current directory and subdirectories. Pytest automatically identifies those files as test files.</p><p>Pytest requires the test function names to start with test. Function names which are not of format test* are not considered as test functions by pytest. We cannot explicitly make pytest consider any function not starting with test as a test function.</p>
