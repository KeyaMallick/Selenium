<p>consider the below situations −</p><p>•	A test is not relevant for some time due to some reasons.</p><p>•	A new feature is being implemented and we already added a test for that feature.</p><p>In these situations, we have the option to xfail the test or skip the tests.</p><p>Pytest will execute the xfailed test, but it will not be considered as part failed or passed tests. Details of these tests will not be printed even if the test fails (remember pytest usually prints the failed test details). We can xfail tests using the following marker −</p><p>@pytest.mark.xfail</p><p><br></p><p>Skipping a test means that the test will not be executed. We can skip tests using the following marker −</p><p>@pytest.mark.skip</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In a real scenario, once a new version of the code is ready to deploy, it is first deployed into pre-prod/ staging environment. Then a test suite runs on it.</p><p>The code is qualified for deploying to production only if the test suite passes. If there is test failure, whether it is one or many, the code is not production ready.</p><p>Therefore, what if we want to stop the execution of test suite soon after n number of test fails. This can be done in pytest using maxfail.</p><p>The syntax to stop the execution of test suite soon after n number of test fails is as follows −</p><p>pytest --maxfail = &lt;num&gt;</p><p><br></p><p>By default, pytest runs tests in sequential order. In a real scenario, a test suite will have a number of test files and each file will have a bunch of tests. This will lead to a large execution time. To overcome this, pytest provides us with an option to run tests in parallel.</p><p>For this, we need to first install the pytest-xdist plugin.</p><p>Install pytest-xdist by running the following command −</p><p>pip install pytest-xdist</p><p><br></p><p> we can run tests by using the syntax pytest -n &lt;num&gt;</p><p>We will not be having much time difference when there is only a few tests to run.</p><p> However, it matters when the test suite is large.</p><p>To install pytest-html: Pip install pytest-html</p><p>Then run your tests with: Pytestb—html=report.html</p>
